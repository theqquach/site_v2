        title: About me
        subtitle: ''
        text: |
          I am a student at the University of British Columbia where I am currently majoring in Statistics & Economics.

          My areas of interests include:

          - Financial Economics
          - Data Science
          - Political Economy and Public Policy
          - Environmental Economics and Sustainability
          - Econometrics and Quantitative Methods

          I'm passionate about using a data-driven approach to explore relationships, answer questions, and provide meaningful recommendations. Although I am most experienced working with financial data, I am always excited to work with different datasets and learn about different industries and projects, as I believe in lifelong learning.
