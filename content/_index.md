        I am a student at the University of British Columbia where I am currently majoring in Statistics & Economics.

        My areas of interests include:

        - Financial Economics
        - Data Science
        - Political Economy and Public Policy
        - Econometrics and Quantitative Methods

        I'm passionate about using a data-driven approach to explore relationships, answer questions, and provide meaningful recommendations. Although I am most experienced working with financial data, I am always excited to work with different datasets and learn about different industries and projects, as I believe in lifelong learning.
