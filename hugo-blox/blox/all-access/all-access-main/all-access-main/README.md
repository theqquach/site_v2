### FAQ

**What does each template folder contain?**

Each template folder consists of a [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)-powered site ready to customize and [deploy](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/deployment/) to your preferred host, such as GitHub Pages or Netlify.

**What version of Hugo Extended does a template support?**

The supported version of Hugo can be found under `HUGO_VERSION` in a template's `netlify.toml` file.

**How can I install Hugo Extended?**

Check out the [Hugo installation guide](https://docs.hugoblox.com/getting-started/install-hugo/).

However, **most users find it easier _not_ to install Hugo**. The easiest way to edit your site is online with the GitHub Editor or GitHub Codespaces (the online version of VSCode), as used in the tutorials.

**How can I use Tailwind Blox in a Bootstrap Template and vice-versa?**

No, Tailwind and Bootstrap are two different CSS styling frameworks and cannot be used together.

## Hide "Published With" in the Footer

With All Access, you can add `i_am_a_sponsor: true` to your `config/_default/params.yaml` to automatically remove the "Published With Hugo Blox" notice from the footer of your site.

However, if you keep the notice, we can get more contributors and thus more improvements to the software. So please consider keeping the notice and just [editing the wording via the language pack](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/language/#interface).
